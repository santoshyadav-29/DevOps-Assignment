# Assignment 3: The Release Architect üöÄ

## Overview

This assignment implements a professional, automated software release pipeline that triggers on Git tags and creates official releases with Docker images, vulnerability scans, and automated changelogs.

---

## Research & Concepts

### 1. Git Tags & Semantic Versioning

**What are Git Tags?**
Git tags are references that point to specific points in Git history. They're commonly used to mark release points (v1.0.0, v2.0.0, etc.).

**Semantic Versioning (SemVer)**
Format: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` (e.g., v1.2.3)

- **MAJOR**: Incompatible API changes (v2.0.0)
- **MINOR**: New functionality, backwards compatible (v1.1.0)
- **PATCH**: Bug fixes, backwards compatible (v1.0.1)

**Pre-release versions:**

- `v1.0.0-alpha` - Early testing phase
- `v1.0.0-beta` - Feature complete, testing
- `v1.0.0-rc.1` - Release candidate

**Resources:**

- [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/)
- [Git Tagging Basics](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging)

### 2. Release Automation

**GitHub Actions for Releases**

**softprops/action-gh-release:**

- Industry-standard action for creating GitHub releases
- Automatic changelog generation
- Asset uploading (binaries, archives)
- Pre-release detection
- Draft release support

**Why Automate Releases?**

- ‚úÖ Consistency across releases
- ‚úÖ Reduces human error
- ‚úÖ Automatic documentation
- ‚úÖ Professional appearance
- ‚úÖ Integration with CI/CD pipeline

**Resources:**

- [softprops/action-gh-release](https://github.com/softprops/action-gh-release)
- [GitHub Releases Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github)

### 3. Multi-Stage Docker Builds

**What is Multi-Stage Build?**
A Dockerfile technique using multiple `FROM` statements to create optimized images.

**Benefits:**

- **Smaller images**: Build dependencies aren't in final image
- **Better security**: Fewer packages = smaller attack surface
- **Separation of concerns**: Build environment vs. runtime environment

**Our Implementation:**

```dockerfile
# Stage 1: Build (Node.js + dependencies)
FROM node:20-alpine AS build
# ... build steps ...

# Stage 2: Production (Nginx only)
FROM nginx:alpine AS production
COPY --from=build /app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html
```

**Result:** Final image is ~67MB instead of 300MB+

**Resources:**

- [Docker Multi-Stage Builds](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/multi-stage/)

### 4. Security Scanning with Trivy

**What is Trivy?**
Open-source vulnerability scanner for containers and other artifacts.

**What it Scans:**

- OS packages (Alpine, Debian, etc.)
- Language-specific dependencies (npm, pip, etc.)
- Known CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)

**Severity Levels:**

- CRITICAL: Immediate action required
- HIGH: Important to fix
- MEDIUM: Should fix when possible
- LOW: Minor issues

**Our Configuration:**

- Scans for CRITICAL and HIGH vulnerabilities
- Fails build if found
- Uploads results to GitHub Security tab

**Resources:**

- [Trivy Documentation](https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy/)
- [GitHub Security Features](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security)

### 5. GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)

**What is GHCR?**
GitHub's container registry for storing Docker images.

**Benefits:**

- Integrated with GitHub
- Free for public repositories
- Automatic authentication with GITHUB_TOKEN
- Fine-grained access control

**Image Naming:**

```
ghcr.io/<owner>/<repository>:<tag>
ghcr.io/santoshyadav-29/leapfrog-journey:v1.0.0
```

## Release Workflow Architecture

### Trigger

```yaml
on:
  push:
    tags:
      - "v*"
```

**Explanation:**

- Only triggers when you push a tag starting with 'v'
- Examples: v1.0.0, v2.1.3-beta, v1.0.0-rc.1
- Does NOT trigger on regular commits

### Workflow Steps

#### 1. Checkout Code

```yaml
- uses: actions/checkout@v4
  with:
    fetch-depth: 0 # Full history for changelog
```

#### 2. Extract Version

Extracts version from tag (e.g., "refs/tags/v1.0.0" ‚Üí "v1.0.0")

#### 3. Login to GHCR

Uses GitHub token for authentication

#### 4. Build Docker Image

Multi-stage build with caching

#### 5. Security Scan (Trivy)

```yaml
- uses: aquasecurity/trivy-action@master
  with:
    severity: "CRITICAL,HIGH"
    exit-code: "1" # Fail if vulnerabilities found
```

**Critical Step:** Build fails if security issues found!

#### 6. Push to Registry

Only happens if security scan passes

#### 7. Generate Changelog

Automatically creates changelog from commits and PRs

#### 8. Create GitHub Release

```yaml
- uses: softprops/action-gh-release@v1
  with:
    body: |
      ## üöÄ Release ${{ version }}
      ### üì¶ Docker Image
      ### üìù Changelog
      ### üîí Security
```

**Includes:**

- Docker pull command
- Changelog
- Security status
- Live demo link
- Auto-detects pre-releases

---

## How to Use

### Creating a Release

#### Step 1: Prepare Your Code

```bash
# Make sure all changes are committed
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Add new feature for release"
git push origin main
```

#### Step 2: Create a Tag

```bash
# For a new version
git tag v1.0.0

# For a pre-release
git tag v1.0.0-beta

# With annotation (recommended)
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release version 1.0.0"
```

#### Step 3: Push the Tag

```bash
git push origin v1.0.0
```

#### Step 4: Watch the Magic ‚ú®

1. GitHub Actions workflow triggers automatically
2. Builds Docker image
3. Scans for vulnerabilities
4. Pushes to GHCR
5. Creates GitHub Release

### Version Numbering Guide

**First Release:**

```bash
git tag v1.0.0
```

**Bug Fix:**

```bash
git tag v1.0.1  # Patch increment
```

**New Feature:**

```bash
git tag v1.1.0  # Minor increment
```

**Breaking Change:**

```bash
git tag v2.0.0  # Major increment
```

**Pre-releases:**

```bash
git tag v1.1.0-alpha.1  # Alpha testing
git tag v1.1.0-beta.1   # Beta testing
git tag v1.1.0-rc.1     # Release candidate
```

---

## Using Released Docker Images

### Pull from GHCR

```bash
# Pull specific version
docker pull ghcr.io/santoshyadav-29/leapfrog-journey:v1.0.0

# Pull latest
docker pull ghcr.io/santoshyadav-29/leapfrog-journey:latest

# Run the container
docker run -d -p 8080:80 ghcr.io/santoshyadav-29/leapfrog-journey:v1.0.0
```

### In Docker Compose

```yaml
services:
  leapfrog:
    image: ghcr.io/santoshyadav-29/leapfrog-journey:v1.0.0
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
```

### In Kubernetes

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: leapfrog-journey
spec:
  containers:
    - name: app
      image: ghcr.io/santoshyadav-29/leapfrog-journey:v1.0.0
```

## Troubleshooting

### Release Not Creating?

**Check:**

1. Did you push the tag? `git push origin v1.0.0`
2. Does tag start with 'v'?
3. Check Actions tab for errors
4. Verify GITHUB_TOKEN permissions

### Security Scan Failing?

**Solutions:**

1. Update base images: `FROM node:20-alpine`
2. Update npm packages: `pnpm update`
3. Check Trivy results in Security tab
4. Fix or suppress specific vulnerabilities

### Docker Push Failing?

**Check:**

1. GHCR permissions set correctly
2. Repository is public or permissions granted
3. GITHUB_TOKEN has `packages: write`
